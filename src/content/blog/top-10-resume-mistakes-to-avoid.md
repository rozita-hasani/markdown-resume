Your resume is often the first impression you make on a potential employer. A strong resume can open doors, but even small mistakes can hurt your chances. To help you create a polished and professional resume, here are the top 10 common mistakes to avoid—and practical tips to fix them.

---

## 1. **Typos and Grammatical Errors**
Mistakes in spelling or grammar can make you seem careless.
- **Fix:** Use tools like Grammarly or have a trusted friend proofread your resume.

---

## 2. **Using a Generic Resume**
Sending the same resume to every job application won't stand out.

- **Fix:** Tailor your resume for each job by highlighting relevant skills and experiences.

---

## 3. **Failing to Include Keywords**
Many companies use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to filter resumes.

- **Fix:** Extract keywords from the job description and include them naturally in your resume (e.g., specific skills or tools).

---

## 4. **Lack of Quantifiable Achievements**
Simply listing job duties doesn't show your impact.

- **Fix:** Include measurable achievements. For example:
- **Weak:** "Managed a team of developers."
- **Strong:** "Managed a team of 5 developers and reduced project delivery time by 20%."

---

## 5. **Overloading with Jargon**
Overusing technical terms or industry-specific jargon can alienate non-technical reviewers.

- **Fix:** Keep language professional but clear. Explain complex terms when necessary.

---

## 6. **Inconsistent Formatting**
Inconsistent fonts, sizes, or spacing can make your resume look unprofessional.

- **Fix:** Use a consistent format for fonts, spacing, and section headings. Many resume builders, like markdown tools, can help standardize this.

---

## 7. **Omitting Contact Information**
Forgetting to include your email address or phone number makes it impossible for recruiters to contact you.

- **Fix:** Always list your full name, phone number, professional email, LinkedIn profile, and portfolio link (if applicable).

---

## 8. **Making It Too Long**
Recruiters spend only a few seconds scanning resumes. Lengthy resumes can overwhelm them.
- **Fix:** Keep it to one page (or two if you have over 10 years of experience). Focus on relevant information only.

---

## 9. **Using a Poor File Format**
Sending a resume in an unsupported file format can make it unreadable.

- **Fix:** Use universally accepted formats like `.pdf` or `.docx`, unless the job posting specifies otherwise.

---

## 10. **Focusing on Responsibilities Instead of Results**
Employers want to see how you add value, not just what you were tasked to do.

- **Fix:** Rewrite bullet points to focus on results. For example:
- **Weak:** "Responsible for website updates."
- **Strong:** "Redesigned website layout, increasing user engagement by 25%."

Avoiding these common mistakes will make your resume more effective and increase your chances of landing an interview. Remember, your resume is your personal marketing tool—invest the time to make it shine!

Happy writing!
